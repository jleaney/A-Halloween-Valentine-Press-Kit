Video World was developed as a predominately solo project over 5 months in 2020. It was inspired by 3 songs written by Jacob Leaney (Creative Director of Things For Humans) for his solo music project Monster Mansion.

Video World is a stand-alone prequal to the upcoming music/narrative game 'I Love You Tokyo'. It includes 2 of the same characters and features similar visuals and gameplay.

The game has been funded by Jacob, with some additional assitance from Film Victoria.
